# SignBridge
ü§ü Sign Language Recognition System
A real-time Pakistan Sign Language (PSL) recognition system using deep learning models (C3D and I3D) to translate sign language gestures into text and speech. This project implements multiple neural network architectures for video-based sign language classification.
ÔøΩÔøΩ Features
Real-time Sign Language Recognition: Live video processing with webcam input
Multiple Model Architectures:
C3D (3D Convolutional Neural Networks)
I3D (Inception 3D Networks)
LSTM
ResNet-based models
Text-to-Speech Output: Converts recognized signs to spoken words
Video File Processing: Upload and analyze pre-recorded sign language videos
GUI Interface: User-friendly desktop application for video upload and prediction
Comprehensive Dataset: Trained on extensive ASL video dataset with 300+ sign classes
ÔøΩÔøΩÔ∏è Technical Stack
Deep Learning: PyTorch, TensorFlow
Computer Vision: OpenCV, Albumentations
Models: C3D, I3D, ResNet50
Audio: gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)
GUI: Tkinter
Data Processing: NumPy, Pandas

ÔøΩÔøΩ Note
I am still working on the realtime translation there are some issues in realtime work because there is not enough dataset to train our model.I am are trying to make the dataset myself will keep you guys updated.
if you have any questions you can hit me up on my email.ok Bye
